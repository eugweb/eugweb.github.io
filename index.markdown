Use the Training Music app and make your competition training according to your needs.

Simple, fast, flexible, intuitive.

The Training Music app was specially developed by the dancer for dancers and coaches to prepare and start the competition training optimally and quickly.

This allows any training format conveniently with the required speed, and to make number and length of heats and pauses.

It is possible to exchange a current title by another one or increase the duration of the tracks without having to interrupt the current workout.

You can control a competition training from your Apple Watch.
